# Java Expression Tree

This is a Java program that builds and evaluates expression trees for basic arithmetic expressions.

## Introduction

This program demonstrates the construction and evaluation of expression trees from arithmetic expressions. It takes an arithmetic expression as input and builds an expression tree using the Shunting Yard algorithm. The program then evaluates the expression tree to compute the result of the expression.

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handles parentheses to respect operator precedence.
- Provides error handling for division by zero.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Java-Expression-Tree.git
javac TreeEvaluator.java
java TreeEvaluator
