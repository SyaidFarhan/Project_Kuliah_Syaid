AutoComplete-DamerauLevenshtein

This project is a C++ implementation of an auto-completion system using the Damerau-Levenshtein distance algorithm. The program suggests words based on user input and ranks them by their similarity to the input word.

## Features

- Auto-completion suggestions using Damerau-Levenshtein distance.
- Interactive console-based user interface.
- Supports adding new words to the suggestion dictionary.
- Efficient sorting and ranking of suggestions.
- Basic dictionary management with saving to a file.

## Usage

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Enter characters to build your word. Press space to accept a suggestion or continue typing.
4. Press `9` to add the current word to the suggestion dictionary.
5. Press `0` to save the current dictionary into a file.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you want to improve the code, enhance documentation, or add new features, follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Make your improvements and commit the changes.
4. Push the changes to your fork.
5. Create a pull request with a description of your changes.
